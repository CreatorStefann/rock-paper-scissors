# rock-paper-scissors
This is the first game I make using JavaScript. It is very basic but everybody starts from somewhere.
It is based on test cases and it evaluates the player's case-insensitive choice and the computer's randomized choice.
The game mode consists of five levels, player vs computer and the score is registered after each round.
